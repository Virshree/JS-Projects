# DARK/LIGHT MODES

* In this project, we'll create a toggle button that switches the website between dark and light modes, with a sliding animation for a more visually appealing transition. 
* We'll use keyframe CSS queries to create the animation and JavaScript to change the background color dynamically. 
* The user's preference will be stored using the browser's local storage, ensuring that their selection persists even if they refresh the page.
* This project will teach you advanced CSS techniques, JavaScript programming, and how to improve the user experience by storing data in the browser.
